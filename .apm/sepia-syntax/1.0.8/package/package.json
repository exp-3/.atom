YMMV\n\nIf you like the theme, please :star: it, or send pull requests if you think you can improve it!\n\n![Sepia screenshot dark](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57252/dark.png)\n\n![Sepia screenshot light](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57252/light.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lucaska/sepia-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/lucaska/sepia-syntax#readme","_id":"sepia-syntax@1.0.8","_shasum":"b58e2694b2edb18685fe294febebcfde6cea8f62","_resolved":"file:../d-116922-6027-xe7eae/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116922-6027-xe7eae/package.tgz"}
