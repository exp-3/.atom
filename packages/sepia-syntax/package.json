  "readme": "#### Sepia is lightweight syntax theme for the Atom editor, based on a few guiding principles:\n\n- Working synergistically with Atom's new One Light and One Dark Themes\n- Being pleasurable to look at for extended periods of time (I want you to like to work in it!)\n- Syntax is contrasted enough to allow you to differentiate things a glance, without them stepping on each other, or blending together.\n- Light, parchment style editor background for people who have glossy monitors or don't work in a dungeon all day.\n\nIf you use OSX, I suggest the Monaco font, which is not only free, but looks really great with this theme. YMMV\n\nIf you like the theme, please :star: it, or send pull requests if you think you can improve it!\n\n![Sepia screenshot dark](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57252/dark.png)\n\n![Sepia screenshot light](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57252/light.png)\n",
