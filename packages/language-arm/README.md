# ARM assembly highlighting for Atom

Adds syntax highlighting for the ARM Assembly language to Atom. This package was originally written to support the ARM instruction set used in teaching at the University of Manchester so some instructions may not be available on all platforms.

## Install

To install the package language-arm:

* In Atom: (Preferences->Install)
* Shell: `$ apm install language-arm`
